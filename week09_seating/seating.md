In thinking of this algorithm, I immediately thought of Alamo Drafthouse. For this theatre, when you are booking tickets, you are limited depending on certain factors. One example is party size. If you are a party of two, you cannot book seats that leave one seat open between yours and another party. You also can't leave a single seat open between the two of you or next to an aisle. 

I would implement something similar to this for airplanes. If you are a party of two or more, you would automatically be assigned to the same row starting from the window out to the aisle. If you are a singleton, you would automatically be placed in a row with less than three people, starting with the aisle seat. Through this, people would be guaranteed to sit with members of their party. The downside is that customers wouldn't necessarily receive their seat preferences (window vs. aisle, etc.)
